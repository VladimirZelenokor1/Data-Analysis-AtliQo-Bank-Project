# Data-Analysis-AtliQo-Bank-Project
This Data Analysis Project is a Real Industry Case Simulating the Launch of a Credit Card for a Bank. 

Dataset Has More Than 50000+ Records.

The Project Consisted of 2 Main Phases:

## Phase 1: Figure out the target market
The main task of the phase is to analyze the data and determine the target audience for our product. Includes:

**1) Data preparation**

1.1 Data cleaning (Handling Null Values), 

1.2 Outlier Treatment (IQR, STD DEV, Mode), 

1.3 Data Visualization (Histogram, Countplots)

**2) Data analysis**

2.1 Distributions (Normal, Skewness), 

2.2 Exploratory analysis (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), 

2.3 Measures of Central Tendency, Measures of Dispersion

## Phase 2: Trial run on a small group

The main task of the phase is to make trial run of our new credit card on a small group and make a hypothesis testing on results. Includes:

**1) Execute campaign**

1.1 Launch campaign for  specific customers

**2) Post-campaign, data collection**

2.1 Collect transactions from target and control customer

**3) Hypothesis testing and decision**

3.1 Central Limit Theorem, 

3.2 Random Sampling and Sampling Bias, 

3.3 Hypothesis testing,

3.4 Confidence Intervals, P value,

3.5 Z test, A/B Testing,

3.6 One and Two Tail Test,

3.7 Standard Error, Type 1 and Type 2 Errors,

3.8 Stat. Power, Effect Size
